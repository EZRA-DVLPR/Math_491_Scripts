# Math_491_Scripts - Numerical Analysis
Scripts for my Math 491 class

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These scripts are Matlab scripts that will perform the titled functions that were needed for the various assignments within
my Math 491 Numerical Analysis Class for Fall 2022.

To run them, they have instructive comments within the files themselves that describe what to change and how they run.
In a general sense, they will take a function and perform the desired technique until they meet a certain error bound (assuming the inputs are correct).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope that people who are looking for circumventing the laborious task of doing these techniques by hand may stumble upon this github repo and be able to use them.
